<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I’m a final-year master’s student in Computational Linguistics (NLP) at the University of Washington, advised by Prof. `Yejin Choi` and Prof. `Tim Althoff`. I also worked closely with Prof. `Shane Steinert-Threlkeld`. 

I was a ML Alignment & Theory Scholar ([MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/)), worked with `Evan Hubinger` from Anthropic on AI values evaluations ([LitmusValues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14633)). 

Currently, I'm a Research Associate at New York University, worked with Prof. `Sydney Levine` from NYU/Google DeepMind and Prof. `Mitchell Gordon` from MIT/OpenAI. Check our recent work, [MoReBench](https://morebench.github.io/) (a PhD-level, rubric-based moral reasoning benchmark), in colloboration with Scale AI!

My research focuses on the intersection of NLP and humans. Broadly, I’m intrigued by how humans understand and think during decision-making, and how technology can help improve those decisions. My goal is to build and enhance *moral, empathetic, and culturally sensitive AI*, with a current focus on real-world data collection and human-AI interactions, and value alignment evaluation for the good of humanity.

Always happy to connect with people who are excited to chat, think, or collaborate on AI value alignment and AI safety research!
