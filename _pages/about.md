<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello! I’m a final-year master’s student in Computational Linguistics (NLP) at the University of Washington, advised by Prof. `Yejin Choi` and Prof. `Tim Althoff`. I also worked closely with Prof. `Shane Steinert-Threlkeld`. My research focuses on the intersection of NLP and humans. Currently, I'm the ML Alignment & Theory Scholar ([MATS](https://www.matsprogram.org/)), worked with `Evan Hubinger` from Anthropic 

Broadly, I’m intrigued by how humans understand and think during decision-making, and how technology can help improve those decisions. My goal is to build and enhance *empathetic, moral, and culturally sensitive AI*, with a current focus on data collection from real-world and evaluation for model alignment on values.
